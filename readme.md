# Creating A Responsive Grid Layout

## Task:

Create a simple CSS Grid layout that when on a wider screen, has 3 columns, and when on a smaller screen, has 1 column.

## What I did:

Created a very simple HTML file with nav bar, "what" section, and an "about" section. Then made a CSS file to give initial styling and set up the grid layout. Finally I added a media query to change the grid layout when the screen is smaller.

## Result:

Success! I was able to create a responsive grid layout that changes from 3 columns to 1 column when the screen is smaller.
